notes: |
  Note that in the provided effect stack only the nodes containing "hello" are marked visible.
  Try to modify the variable name, and you'll see all of them disappear (from the graphics, not from
  the simulated environment).
  Try to open the node content, and see how the concentration values got parsed
  Also take a look to the effects, and see how it is possible to alter a color channel in order to obtain
  a fancy coloring of your nodes.
